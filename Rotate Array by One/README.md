# [Rotate Array by One](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/cyclically-rotate-an-array-by-one2614/1)

## 🧠 Difficulty
**Basic**

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]`, rotate the array by **one position** in **clockwise direction**.

That means:
- The last element becomes the first.
- All other elements are shifted to the next index.


## 📥 Input

- A list of integers `arr[]` of size `N`.

## 📤 Output

- Return the array rotated by one position to the right (clockwise).


## ✅ Constraints

- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`
- `0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`


## 🔍 Examples

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: Last element 5 comes to the front.
